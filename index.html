<p id="team">Evolution Robotics has been a FIRST Technical Challenge team since September 2015. We were previously a FLL team since 2010. Since then, we've gained many new members and much experience and expertise. We've won various awards for robot design, programming, and performance, and take great pride in our ability to engineer practical solutions and implement new and unique ideas that set us apart from everyone else. This year, our second year as an FTC team, has been an exciting experiment in what happens when omniwheels are combined with flailing rubber tubes, pitching machines, and kitchen drawers.</p>
<p id="robot" class="invisible">Marv Mk7 is our robot, constructed primarily of Pitsco Tetrix structural hardware. It has a thouroughly crazy wheel-base, which is composed of four omnidirectional wheel sets, each driven by its own DC motor. Using equally crazy software, Marv aids our human drivers by handling details, such as robot-orientation compensation, that would otherwise have to be judged mentally by our drivers. Marv consumes 'particles' using a fast-spinning lift, and can store up to five before launching them at variable angle using two high-speed rotating wheels.</p>
<p id="events" class="invisible">5/22/16: Evolution demonstrated the robot to the two new FLL teams in our community.  These teams consist of 4th through 6th Graders from Hadley Elementary School. <br><br>Late May, 2016: We displayed our robot for the physics and computer science classes at Hopkins Academy. All the classes got to see the robot in action, and had a chance to drive the robot. <br><br>7/29/16: We demonstrated our robot to the seniors at the Hadley Senior Center. The team members who were there that day displayed our robot's controls and functions and the playing field to the seniors. <br><br>11/5/16: Evolution exhibited the robot at Barnes and Noble's Mini Maker Faire in Hadley. The team members had fun zooming the robot around on the floor and testing the driving base.</p>
