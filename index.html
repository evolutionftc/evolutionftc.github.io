We had “evolved” from a prior FLL team that was created in September 2010, when one of the original team members, Aedan, found out about the leagues at a FLL competition and was interested in creating one in Hadley Elementary. The rest of the original members of FLL were Alex, Kyle, and Ryan, but later on more people joined such as Kieran and Zach, as well as Cade and Talula. Each team member were assigned to the certain task that had to be achieved in every meeting. Over those years of being part of the league, the team had won various awards for robot design, programming and performance, and innovative project solutions, and took part in several state competitions in almost every year.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By 2015, the older members became too old for being participating in FLL, since they were in their 8th grade, and the whole team moved up to FIRST Tech Challenge, in the summer-fall of that same year. Within the year, we have gained Bobby and Alvin as the newest members. At every meeting taken place in our town’s Senior Center, like in FLL, all the members are assigned to their own tasks that are based on what they preferred, whether it be designing, building, or programming</p></div>
